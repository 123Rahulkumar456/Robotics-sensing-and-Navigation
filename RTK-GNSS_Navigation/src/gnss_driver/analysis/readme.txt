The analysis is done in Matlab.

In order to run the program, first load the .mat file which contains the data.

After loading, the program can run and various graphs will also be plotted.

# For Stationary Open condition
stationaryOpen.mat      #Matlab Data file
stationaryOpen.m        #Matlab script for analysis

# For Stationary Blocked condition
stationaryBlocked.mat   #Matlab Data file
stationaryBlocked.m     #Matlab script for analysis

# For Moving Open condition
movingOpen.mat          #Matlab Data file
movingOpen.m            #Matlab script for analysis

# For Moving Blocked condition
movingBlocked.mat       #Matlab Data file
movingBlocked.m         #Matlab script for analysis
